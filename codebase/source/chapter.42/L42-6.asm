; C near-callable function to draw an antialiased line from
; (X0,Y0) to (X1,Y1), in mode 13h, the VGA's standard 320x200 256-color
; mode. Uses an antialiasing approach published by Xiaolin Wu in the July
; 1991 issue of Computer Graphics. Requires that the palette be set up so
; that there are NumLevels intensity levels of the desired drawing color,
; starting at color BaseColor (100% intensity) and followed by (NumLevels-1)
; levels of evenly decreasing intensity, with color (BaseColor+NumLevels-1)
; being 0% intensity of the desired drawing color (black). No clipping is
; performed in DrawWuLine. Handles a maximum of 256 intensity levels per
; antialiased color. This code is suitable for use at screen resolutions,
; with lines typically no more than 1K long; for longer lines, 32-bit error
; arithmetic must be used to avoid problems with fixed-point inaccuracy.
; Tested with TASM 4.0 by Jim Mischel 12/16/94.
